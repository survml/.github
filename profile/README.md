Welcome to our organization's GitHub repository! I am a PhD candidate and data scientist dedicated to developing machine learning models for survival analysis of equipment. My mission is to advance the state-of-the-art in predicting time-to-failure outcomes using data from various industries, with the ultimate goal of improving reliability and efficiency of equipment.

## What is Survival Analysis?   

Survival analysis is a branch of statistics that studies the time until an event of interest occurs, such as death, disease recurrence, or failure of a mechanical system. Survival analysis is commonly used in medical research, engineering, and other fields where the time-to-event outcome is of primary interest.

## Our Approach
I focus on developing machine learning models that can accurately predict time-to-failure outcomes from equipment data. My models use a variety of techniques, including deep learning, survival trees, and Cox proportional hazards regression. I also explore novel methods for feature selection and data preprocessing to improve model performance.

## Repository Contents
This repository contains code for my machine learning models, as well as scripts for data preprocessing and analysis. I also include sample datasets and Jupyter notebooks to demonstrate how to use my models.

## Contributing
I welcome contributions from researchers and data scientists interested in advancing the field of survival analysis for equipment. If you have ideas for improving my models or want to contribute to my codebase, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
